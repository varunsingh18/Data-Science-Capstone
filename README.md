# Data-Science-Capstone- Final submission


Paris is the capital and the most populous city of France and has a population of more than 2.1 million people. It is the second most expensive city in the world so the residents living closer to city center are likely to have higher income. And Paris is the most visited city in the world due to its famous heritage sites and museums. With itâ€™s diverse culture, comes diverse food items. There are many restaurants in Paris, each belonging to different categories like Chinese, Indian , French etc.
 For this project I have selected the city of Paris to analyze its geospatial data to select a location to setup a new restaurant. The decision will have to be made using data driven approach where we will analyze the geospatial data and use the location of the existing restaurants, cafes, and bistros.

Data:
The data has been downloaded from https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/arrondissements/table/?dataChart and uploaded on the github account. And then again extracted it from my own github account.
I will use the following API for geolocation:	Foursquare API: to find restaurant/venues

What type of clients or a group of people would be interested in this project?
1.	Business personnel who wants to invest or open a restaurant. This analysis will be a comprehensive guide to start or expand restaurants targeting the large pool of office workers in Tokyo during lunch hours.
2.	Freelancer who loves to have their own restaurant as a side business. This analysis will give an idea, how beneficial it is to open a restaurant and what are the pros and cons of this business.
3.	New graduates, to find reasonable lunch/breakfast place.
4.	Budding Data Scientists, who want to implement some of the most used Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to obtain necessary data, analyze it, and, finally be able to tell a story out of it.
